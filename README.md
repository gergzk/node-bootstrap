# node-bootstrap
Just a dumb hello world. No seriously, I'm just practicing build steps on here.

What's left: 
1. Using TS
2. Creating a bundle - webpack
3. Creating more than one bundle
4. Consuming one bundle from the other
5. Factoring out shared code between bundles
6. Using the bundles from a couple HTML pages
7. import vs require

## Tests

  `npm test`
